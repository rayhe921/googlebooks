This is a React App that allows the user to query through the Google Books API for book titles. 

Each query will include the following:

    - Book Title
    - Author
    - An Image of the book cover
    - A short summary of the book

Once the query is complete the user has the open to save a book from the list of results or view the google API link.

Saved books can be viewed on the saved tab up top.
